Docker is a tool that allows developers to package and deploy applications in a standardized and isolated environment called a container. Using Docker can make it easier to develop, test, and deploy applications, because it allows developers to be confident that their code will run the same way in any environment.
Learning Docker can help developers to build, test, and deploy applications more efficiently, and can make it easier to manage and scale applications in production.
